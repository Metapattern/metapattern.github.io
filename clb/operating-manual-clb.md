*Dear Marita: a few months ago, Alexis asked us the following questions:*



# How do I feel cared for?


Feed me.

*The number one predictor of my mood and general well-being is my blood-sugar level. If ever I plunge into a state of terror, or if we ever need to have a difficult conversation, simply make sure I'm fed.*


Pet me.

*I absolutely love feeling closeness through simple touch. Rubbing my shoulders, scratching my back or my scalp, holding my arm, or my leg, or my hand... It tells me more than a thousand words could that you're here, that you love me, and we're in this together.*


Take me for walks.

*Getting out and into the world is how I reconnect with myself. The perspective reminds me of my life's context, and the movement helps to loosen my mind.*


Leave me little notes around the house.

*The feeling of discovering a little moment of loving thoughtfulness leaves behind a residue of love throughout our shared spaces*.


Message me your moment.

*Share with me your present moment, including as much detail as possible, for no reason at all. I love these little windows into your world. (Preferably in Emoji)*.


Cook for me, deliciously.

*Don't get me wrong... I'm happy to be your sous chef. But a lovingly cooked, healthy, delicious meal is a surefire way to reciprocate the feeling of providing that I express through my work, space and general abundance. Basically, I'll buy the ingredients if we can cook it together.* 


Cuddle.

*Those little moments, the liminal spaces at the beginning and end of the day, are precious. The tone and texture of these moments sets the frame for the whole day. Let's start our days with love, connection and presence*!


Fold my socks (once in a while).

*Literally, and metaphorically. Helping with these little chores around the house is a delightful demonstration of humble love. I promise to fold your little panties with delicate care, if you'll fold my socks when it's your turn.*  


Show me you’re listening.

*Your eyes, your touch, your tone of voice. So many little cues tell me you're with me, verbally or non-verbally. I find that most of the time, all I (or anybody) wants is to feel heard, to feel received. So please, receive me. I promise to reciprocate.*


Laugh with me.

*Believe it or not, I'm funny. Loosen up and be willing to be silly with me sometimes, or witty, or sarcastic. It's how I 'play' with language and my mind, and it's a huge source of connection and intimacy for me. I need to feel free to make bad (or occasionally good) jokes. It's literally essential to the spirit of fun, nimble, and spontaneous life that I rely on to do my personal and professional work.*

*If you don't think I'm funny, it's a problem. I can't convince you, and without feeling funny I feel significantly unseen.* 



# How do I share care?


Cultivating sacred space. 
<!-- .slide: data-background="lib/img/metatelier.jpg" class="dark" -->

*Bringing intention and mindfulness to the spaces we occupy is one of my favorite human activities, and one of the primary ways I express my devotion to the sacred. These spaces are the containers of our consciousness, the literal environments from which our subjective and intersubjective experiences emerge.*

*From music, to scents, to decor, I take deep care in every conceivable detail, so your conscious and unconscious minds feel entirely nourished, inspired and safe.*


Collaborating on creative projects.
<!-- .slide: data-background="lib/img/mudra.png" class="dark" -->

*Our creative potential together is one of the most inspiring and attractive aspects of our love. It's also where I feel most empowered and alive. Let me collaborate with you, to bring your art to life with craft and care. Now, I collaborate best when we both have clear, complementary domains: You dance, I photograph. You do yoga or mudras, I film and edit.*

*Flow is a delicate thing, and I find it's best to maintain agency over our individual domains. I almost never know what something is going to be until I make it, so please leave me the space to discover it, without criticism or controlling.*


Curiosity for you.
<!-- .slide: data-background="img/IMG_0082.jpg" class="dark" -->

*Your life, dreams, process and art. For México, your Spanish and French and dance; for your embodiment, movement and touch.*



# How do I feel respected?


Recognize my talents.

*I feel uniquely gifted, in both the desire and aptitude for learning, in wisdom, and in aesthetics.*

*Tell me so, often. We can only see ourselves in reflection, so reflect my best qualities to me often and I promise to embody them often.* 


Be patient.

*I take a long view on life, inspired by my spiritual and philosophical elders. And while I have perennial aspirations for beauty, growth and wealth, I also know that **this is it**. All we have or will ever have is this moment, so enjoy the fuck out of it or you never will. We are literally contenders for the luckiest humans ever to live. Let's enjoy the ride while we work towards our next frontier.*


Trust me.

*Trust that I'm a good man. I will generally always do my best to treat you with kindness, love and respect, while maintaining my own personal boundaries and self-love. Trust that my (our) life will be abundant, purposeful and beautiful. Trust that I'm doing my best, and that like all of us, I'm a work in process (who is still entirely lovable and whole today, just as I am).*


Love unconditionally.

*I know it sounds like a tall order, but let me know that your love and support for me isn't contingent on achievement, or in pleasing you, or in anything outside of simply being. Let's recalibrate the scale, where baseline is love, and all the 'treats' are just frosting on the cake. I promise to do the same.*


# How do I show respect?


Presence.

*I will always give you my undivided attention, and truly listen to and receive you. I believe our presence, the quality of our attention, is one of the most fundamental and powerful ways to express love. When I'm with you, you can count on my to be fully with you.*


Openness.

*I absolutely support your process of being and becoming, and will always maintain an open mind and supportive spirit for the things that truly matter to you. It doesn't necessarily mean I agree, or that we're compatible in a way that's mutually nourishing, but I'll always hold space for your side.*
