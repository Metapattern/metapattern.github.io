# Blink #
##### Identity & Experience #####

*An proposal by Metapattern*



<!-- .slide: data-background="/lib/img/eye.JPG" data-background-color="#000" class="white narrow" id="welcome" -->
## Eyecare, evolved. ##

After years of brilliant research and development, EyeNetra has the potential to change how the world sees on a truly massive scale. You've won awards, wowed TED, and earned the respect (and investment) of billionaires. But now, it's time to go to market. To succeed, you'll need to understand your customer's needs, construct a compelling brand identity and a simple and delightful brand experience.

But how?

The way most agencies work is what the valley calls Waterfall Development - putting enormous resources behind what is essentially a guess, and testing it only once it gets to market.

We propose an alternative approach: Agile. Make many small bets - learn continuously. Build high level prototypes instead of polished products. Increase fidelity over time. Test early and often. Let customers (not consultants) decide what works and what doesn't. 

We're here to help.


### The Past ###
<!-- .slide: data-background="/lib/img/chart.jpg" id="past" class="narrow" -->

<img src="/lib/img/timeline-past.svg" width="60%" />

Humans are, first and foremost, visual creatures. Through our eyes, we've evolved to see symbols, make tools and intuit trust in the eyes of others.

With time or misfortune, vision problems are inevitable for each of us. But despite our fate, we cannot help but defy Nature. From primitive corrective lenses in ancient China, to the Italian renaissance to our modern medical industry, we have always developed tools to see the world more clearly.


### The Present ###
<!-- .slide: data-background="/lib/img/phoropter.jpg" id="present" class="narrow" -->

<img src="/lib/img/timeline-present.svg" width="60%" />

Complex tools exist today, but they're slow, disconnected and expensive. Even the simplest vision procedure, like ordering new contacts, requires hours of time, hundreds of dollars and a complex reimbursement process.

While digital services like Uber have disrupted entrenched industries from mobility to dry cleaning, vision care is stuck in the last millenium. Just ask yourself... when was the last major innovation in eye care?


### The Future ###
<!-- .slide: data-background="/lib/img/netra-2.jpg" id="future" class="narrow" -->

<img src="/lib/img/timeline-future.svg" width="60%" />

Emerging out of the MIT Media Lab, EyeNetra develops a low-cost networked eye exam. In 2015 they launch Blink, a true revolution in eye care that seamlessly connects thousands of Visioneers around the world to a team of optometrists for remote diagnosis and prescription. From Denver to Denmark to Denpasar, millions of people finally gain access to world-class eye care through a delightfully simple service.

*But the future is only the beginning...*

#### Our Process ####


<!-- .slide: class="wide" -->
### Phase 1 / Vision ###

*1 week*

>Before we can begin, we must define a north star. 18 months from launch, how many people will have heard of us? How many will we have treated? What magazines will talk about us? What cities will we launch in?

### A Human Right ###
##### Identity / Digital #####

Metapattern worked with [A Human Right](http://www.ahumanright.org), a globally-focused NGO dedicated to connecting the 5 Billion humans currently living without internet access, to refine their brand identity and launch an immersive storytelling experience through a redesigned website. We crafted a series of visual vignettes to bring to life the global importance of the internet, from Kenya to Afghanistan to Egypt.

With the aid of our identity and storytelling design, A Human Right's founder Kosta Grammatis (a Media Lab alumnus) was a finalist for last year's TED Prize, and the site has reached hundreds of thousands of visitors.

### Essential Oxygen ###
##### Identity / Packaging / Digital ######
EssentialOxygen is dedicated to making the cleanest and most effective oral health products possible. While most oral care products contain chemicals like flouride and sodium laurel sulfate which are proving counterproductive to oral health, EssentialOxygen's unique formulations use only food-grade hydrogen peroxide and organic essential oils.

EssentialOxygen approached Metapattern to establish their brand identity, including visual design, digital marketing and packaging design. When we began working together, EssentialOxygen was printing labels at home and selling from a farmers market. Today, their products are in over 2,500 stores nationwide, including every Whole Foods, with annual sales over $1 million. 


<!-- .slide: data-background="/lib/img/case-advance.jpg" class="narrow" -->
### Advance ###
##### Architecture / Identity / Experience #####

Metapattern's first spin-off company, Advance builds and operates nomadic camps for creative exploration. Think 21st-century zen safari camp. Off-grid eco-luxury, packed into modified shipping containers and deployable anywhere on Earth to host intimate gatherings for groups to connect with themselves, each other and Nature.

We initiated and led the project including initial concept, business plan, physical architecture, furniture, experience design, operations strategy, brand identity, photography, digital renders, marketing materials and website. We executed the launch campaign for the first camp deployment and positioned Advance as a state of the art premium experience in a new market (nomadic luxury hospitality).

### Rest ###
##### Naming / Identity / Digital #####

Founded by 3 young mechanical engineers from MIT, [Rest](http://www.restdevices.com) is a Boston-based biotechnology company aiming to disrupt the sleep diagnostic market with a radically more comfortable and efficient system for identifying respiratory disorders using sensors embedded in sleepwear.

Rest (then 'Nyx') approached Metapattern to develop their naming, visual identity and digital marketing. Today their focused on developing an innovative line of baby monitors, while their sleep apnea detection systems awaits FDA approval.
