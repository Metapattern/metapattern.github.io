##### Where we are #####
<br>
### Healthcare is the biggest issue of our time. ###
Healthcare / ACA is Obama's legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. The innovations around bundled payments will put patients back in the center, alignining incentives for providers, and introducing efficiencies through improved collaboration and communication.
