##### Where we are #####
<br>
### Healthcare is the biggest issue of our time. ###
Healthcare / ACA is Obama's legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. The innovations around bundled payments will put patients back in the center, alignining incentives for providers, and introducing efficiencies through improved collaboration and communication.

##### Who you are #####
<br>
## Remedy blends expertise with innovation. ##
Well funded, highly capable, and deeply relevant. You're growing fast, and this is truly just the beginning. Cooperation. Analytics. Modern healthcare. Episodes. 

Blends the deep experience in VC and healthcare companies with the juniors' contemporary technological approach (and energy!!). Killer combo.

Make sure that your brand, story and culture are dialed before this thing gets any bigger.

You are the grandfather, "you can trust us" of the healthcare industry. Innovators. Pioneers. Facilitators of the future.

##### Who we are #####
<br>
## Metapattern is a studio for emergent design. ##
We are fast, immersive, storytellers: are a nimble, multidisciplinary creative team rooted in identity design,rapid prototyping and film. We believe in working light and fast until the work is ripe, then going deep to harvest 

The process is the product. Work in the medium. Emotions before ideas. 

We believe that our process is our work. The curiosity we cultivate in truly understanding your work will live on in deliverables that your entire company, today and tomorrow, can revist and build on.
