##### Where we are #####
<br>
### Healthcare is the biggest issue of our time. ###
ACA will be Obama's legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. Specifically, innovations around bundled payments put patients back in the center.

A revolution is afoot. Bundled payments are the future. It started with Medicare, and it's only going to grow from here.

It's time to bring humanity back to healthcare.
