## Let's begin. ##


### The biggest issue of our time. ###
Healthcare / ACA is Obama's legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. The innovations around bundled payments will put patients back in the center, alignining incentives for providers, and introducing efficiencies through improved collaboration and communication.

## Who are you? ##
Well funded, highly capable, and deeply relevant. You're growing fast, but this is truly just the beginning.


#### Experience + Innovation ####
Blends the elder's experience in VC and healthcare companies with the juniors' contemporary technological approach. Killer combo.



## Who are we? ##

Factory. Blink. Rest. 

"Only a fool sells his knowledge. We sell our curiosity. Our work is the process of finding things out."


#### Fast ####
Rapid prototyping. Nimble multidisciplinary teams. Vertically integrated.


#### Immersive ####
The process is the product. Work in the medium. Emotions before ideas. 


#### Craftsmen & Storytellers ####
We tell human stories. What does Remedy mean for my Mother? My future son? My insurance company? My doctor?



## What will we do together? ##


#### Lead a revolution. ####


#### Launch a world-class brand. ####


#### Build a culture of passion. ####



# Let's do this. #
