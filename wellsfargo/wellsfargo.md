##### Where we are #####
<br>
### Rapid Prototyping accelerates innovation. ###
The Affordable Care Act will be Obama's great legacy. It's the most important issue of our time. 

A revolution is afoot. Innovations around bundled payments are inverting industry economics and puting patients back at the center. It started with Medicare, but that is just the beginning. 

It's time to bring humanity back to healthcare.

##### Who we are #####
<br>
## Metapattern is a studio for emergent design. ##
We are immersive storytellers: a nimble, multidisciplinary creative team rooted in rapid prototyping, identity design and filmmaking. We believe in working light and fast until things become ripe, then going deep to harvest. 

We work with Fortune 100 innovation teams, including Nike, GE, Levi's, and Cisco to rapid-prototype their future and build momentum behind it.  We work with startups to craft strategic direction and get to market gracefully.  We work with leaders and teams to create culture and build alignment. We love the work we do and who we do it with.

Our process *is* our work. We embed to get close to the heartbeat.  Distilling the eternal to understand next steps.  And build things by taking away the nonessential.  Always with an eye for what's wanting to emerge.

We are Metapattern.

##### Where we're going #####
<br>
## What's possible together? ##


#### Lead a revolution ####
*(through the power of storytelling)*

We will champion human-centered healthcare, driecting the difinitive short film that reveals and crystallizes the revolution that's already taking place. Our story moves between single patient and doctor stories. It reveals the differences in human experience between the way things were and the way they will be.  The story will speak to the individual, to industry as a whole, and to the broad economic reform underway.

#### Build a culture of passion ####
*(through an internal cultural microsite)*

The curiosity we cultivate in truly understanding your work will live on in a medium that your entire company, today and tomorrow, can revist and build on.

We will help you build Remedy's culture by creating a core identity and communicating it internally through an integrated microsite.  When you're hiring new people every week, you'll have a compelling tool for onboarding and educating them about Remedy's deep purpose. It'll build alignment, trust, solidarity, excitement, and a shared understanding amongst current and future employees. It will help you attract and retain the best talent in the industry.

#### Launch a world-class brand ####
*(through simple, clear design)*

Iconic, leading the movement. We are facilitating of the future of health. We are change agents. Innovators, who truly care.
The wise elder, trustworthy yet contemporary.

##### What's next #####
<br>
# Let's begin. #
We propose to start at the beginning, with a discovery process to uncover Remedy's roots. From there we'll write, shoot and edit a compelling Hero video to generate emotional resonance and share your story. Then we'll collect the inspiration that birthed Remedy, from audio interviews to reading lists, and assemble it into an interactive microsite to help share your passion and perpective with your current and future team.

Let's bring humanity back to healthcare.
