# Thync
##### The Vibe Experience
<br><br>
_ A proposal by Metapattern _



#### Welcome

We are Metapattern, a new breed of strategic design studio.
Over the past five years we’ve worked with startups to conceive of and launch products and services, as well as some of the biggest companies in the world to rapid prototype solutions to some of their greatest challenges.  Our team consists of makers, operators, strategists and visionaries.  We’re happy to be here with you.

Let’s get started.



#### Meta-Context

We see the startup lifecycle broadly segmented into four stages: Discovery, Validation, Efficiency, and Scale.  It’s important for the health of a company to remain balanced for resources to be channeled towards the shortest path to reaching the next stage in the sequence.

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.



#### Achieving Product/Market Fit
We saw an opportunity to create a marketplace for Vibes, the iTunes store of guided neurosignaling, to bring together creators and consumers to redefine what’s possible within this new medium.

Before we do that, we need to ensure that the standard Vibe experience is a ‘must-have.’  We need to nail that before we can dream of evolving the business model towards a marketplace.



#### Opportunity
Content is king. We’re going to 10x the Vibe.

In order for this technology to really catch on, the experience needs to be seamless, integrated, and fully engaging.  By guiding users through the flow of a Vibe, they feel cared for, and the Thync experience becomes more human.

We need to learn the basic parameters of what makes a great guided Vibe experience.  Our aim is to discover, test, validate, and polish a set of two standard Vibes that ship with Thync and enhance the user experience by a measurable factor.



#### The Engagement

1––Discovery) examine existing user research.
2––Synthesis) formulate a set of customer archetypes based on existing research.
3––Research) conduct new research against those types.
4––Frame) build a framework for guided Vibes to inform content creation and experimentation (male vs. female voice, etc.)
5––Design) design an experiment to test Vibe styles against customer archetypes (40 real customers, two sound designers, two voice artists, four testing rounds)
6––Immerse) run the experiment with real customers and content creators (teams in San Francisco and/or Los Gatos create pop-up Vibe spaces to test multiple variations with customers)
7––Measure) benchmark user’s experience of each of the guided vibes against baseline quantitative and qualitative research.
8––Package) present our process, insights, and findings via an interactive microsite, with videos, photos, and a clear story.
9––Ship) a set of two studio-quality Vibes that will ship with every Thync device (one for Calm, one for Energy).
10––Map) road map next steps for testing in the market.



#### The Experiment
Three teams test against three distinct customer archetypes to prototype and measure the impact of different styles of guided Vibes per our framework.  In total 20-50 customers are tested and provide survey based as well as qualitative feedback.  Vibes go ‘head-to-head’ until there is a clear set of characteristics that emerge as preferred by each segment.  Those findings are synthesized and refined and tested again on day two.

// Design Sprint Timeline
## Monday: Immersion Pre-Production / Preparing Teams
## Tuesday: Content Creation Day
## Wednesday: Immersion–Day 1 (10-25 customers tested)
## Thursday: Immersion-Day 2 (10-25 customers tested)
## Friday: Synthesis / Studio Time



#### Timeline
- **Discovery / Diagnostic** - **Proposed: Tuesday August 25th** Deep dive at Thync HQ to examine current user research and knowledge base, understand more of the history, learn about the creation of Vibes, and build trust and rapport with the team.
- **Research** - **Proposed: Week of August 31st**  Customer Development and User Research interviews with one dozen of Thync’s current users + surveys to an additional 50+.
- **Architecting Immersion / Pre-Production** - **Proposed: Week of September 7th** Incorporating research findings into the design of a weeklong experiment for testing guided Vibe content against user Archetypes.
- **Prototyping Sprint / Studio Time** - **Proposed: Week of September 14th** - Executing the Immersion in San Francisco and/or Los Gatos.  Refining and recording in studio two complete guided Vibes.
