# Welcome.


#### Introduction
# The big picture.

Metapattern was invited to help Thync 10x the Vibe experience.

We conducted a series of interviews with your most active users in order to better understand their needs and use cases.

This is what we found.



#### Methodology
# Blending Customer Development and User Research

Our interviews took place over Google Hangout and Phone.  Most lasted 30 minutes.

We followed the overall arc of the Lean Movement’s Problem Interview–probing for psychographic information first before exploring process-to-buy, use case, results, and relevance.

Then we tacked on questions about habits of use, and users’ experience of guided vibes.



#### Metrics
# By the numbers.


#### Love
<h4 class="big">28%</h4>
Users who would be "very disappointed" if they could no longer use Thync.

*40% is typically considered "product-market fit"*


#### Age

<h4 class="big">47</h4>

*Surprisingly old given some of our assumptions about adoption of wearables in general*


#### Onboarding
<h4 class="big">62%</h4>

<div class="fragment">

#### Key Findings

## High level learnings.  


## They do their homework.
Most did intensive research before purchasing the product.  Many “read everything there was on the internet.”

*Scientifically minded audience: media, messaging, and marketing should speak at this level (eg. white papers).*


## Cleanliness is next to...
Most users are hoping for a *clean* source of energy and focus/motivation.

*Many are finding Thync a viable alternative to various stimulants.*


## Friends with Benefits.
Fairly standard distribution of benefit: from no benefit, to marginal, clear benefit, to ‘lifesaver’.

*Most users are having fairly good results, and some are experiencing life-changing outcomes.*


## Good Vibes.
Most users have a good experience with Vibes once they’re onboard properly. 

*The medium itself is foreign and can create doubt and uncertainty in new users.*


## Unity in Diversity.
Other than males, no clear group stands out.

*Users vary widely in both psychographic, geographic, and demographic characteristics.*



#### Opportunities
# Room to Grow.


## Onboarding.
Onboarding experience varied widely based on engagement with YouTube videos or customer support team.  Almost all users had questions during onboarding.

*Opportunity to make this richer and potentially require running 1-3 welcome Vibes before unlocking others.*


## Doubt. 
Some users left with doubt even after onboarding.  “Is this the effect I’m looking for?  Am I using it properly/optimally?”  

*Opportunity to coin language that describes the Vibe experience in a way that resonates.*


## Strips.
Consistent feedback that the Strips are the largest area of improvement, from both a usability and longevity standpoint.  

*Opportunity to create a “Pro Kit” that’s reusable, or innovate on the strips going forward.*


## Socialization.
Questions about intervals of use, others’ habits compared to their own.  

*Opening for social dimension, sharing dimension post-Vibe.*.


## Case Studies.
Almost all were excited to hear about other use cases including athletics and meditation. 

*Opportunity to include three model use cases and even calendaring with the device*




#### Our Perspective
# Paths forward.


#### Adoption

# The Chasm has not been Crossed.
With 4,000 devices sold and just 1,000 in the wild, it’s the perfect time to go deep with customers to understand how they’re using Thync, and how it could evolve.

** Our Perspective: **
*Although current marketing and messaging is focused on the mainstream/early majority, the product today is most suitable for early adopters and campaigns should be focused as such.*


#### Audience

# Find your footing.

The early adopter base will require a high level of investment in optimizing the product’s use.  Mainstream users simply won’t be willing to make the tradeoffs necessary to make this version of Thync a part of their lives.

** Our Perspective: **
*Success of this version of the product requires a base of 1,000 dedicated evangelists.  Preliminary psychographics point to the self-improvement / biohacker / Tim Ferriss & Dave Asprey crowd as having the most potential given their willingness to experiment and their focus on self improvement in both  kinesthetic and affective dimensions.*


#### Evangelists

# It takes a Village. 

What’s missing is a dedicated tribe of evangelists.  Like GoPro and FitBit, Thync must become a community-driven technology platform.

** Our Perspective: **
*Rather than focusing on Amazon retargeting ads, the company’s resources could be better spent creating an online/offline community of die-hard users who simply love Thync, and love talking about it.  This, coupled with a social layer to connect Vibe experiences and make them sharable, would lay the groundwork for a V.2 product that's ready for a wider market.*


#### Quick Wins

# Low hanging fruit.

Changes in the onboarding experience, the inclusion of guided Vibes, some UX tweaks, and improvement in the reusability of strips are all quick wins that can go a long way.

** Our Perspective: **
*Perfecting the basics of the Thync experience should be the company’s number one focus before scaling.  The risk is scaling prematurely without working out these kinks (and making a bad first impression).*


#### Up Next

# Let's get started.

As a part of our design, we’ve reached out to a core group that we believe 
could become members of the Thync community, including some key influencers and gatekeepers.

** Our Perspective: **
*By building strong relationships and validating assumptions against a control group, we can further our inquiry about the best people to target during these early stages of the Thync life cycle.*


#### Disclaimer

# We’re with you.

These perspectives represent our humble opinion, based on a limited understanding and small sample set.  We honor the deep work that this team has put into developing what can only be called a revolutionary product.  Our hope is that these insights can contribute to the evolution of not only this product, but of the company as a whole.  We’re honored to have a seat at the table, and are dedicated to doing all we can to make Thync successful.


# Thank you.
