# Hello.
We’d like to personally welcome you to the Wells Fargo Maker Lab. This is an environment for learning and collaboration. There is no wrong answer.

In our time together, we will be focusing on three outcomes:
1. equipping you with the tools, libraries and knowledge to be successful
2. practicing prototyping together in teams
3. designing and simulating your own learning environments in the future.

We are excited for the next two days of our journey together.
Welcome to the Maker Lab.

## What should I bring the day of?

- Your computer
- A notepad

- A smile

## What should I expect?

Over the course of the two days, we will go deep into the mindset and process of rapid prototyping, applying and practicing with real challenges the company is facing. Each day will have a specific focus: 

- Day 1: History, tools, and methodology. 
- Day 2: How to create teams, make the best use of time, and prototype most effectively. 

We will be providing healthy breakfast, lunch and snacks across the two days.

## What are the desired outcomes?

We seek to fortify the Wells Fargo team’s capability in rapid prototyping, from strategy through execution. Our curriculum is designed to be practical and tactical so that you can immediately  integrate your learnings into your professional work and organizational culture. You will learn how to frame problems, harvest collaborative input and translate your insights  into visual, tangible prototypes. We’ll take time for play and movement throughout the day to stimulate creativity and joy, and have some fun. 

The key areas of focus are:

### Mindset
* Cultivating creative confidence

### Toolkit

* Assemble a tool library designed for speed and agility

### Direct Experience

* Learn by doing; make it real.

# Contact Information

If you have have any questions or emergencies, please don’t hesitate to contact our producer, Chad Owen.
