		<h3>Our History</h3>
<h1>Remedy Started in a Family of Dreamers</h1>
	</div>

		<h3>United By a Dream</h3>
<p>A serious health episode can make anybody feel alone, confused and overwhelmed. We see a tremendous opportunity to unite families and care teams around a patient during and after a hospitalization - when patients are most in need of love and support.
<br><br>
We take this responsibility seriously and constantly remind each other that every patient in Remedy’s program is someone’s mother, brother, father, sister, friend or other relative. Empathy for the challenges patients face after a hospitalization keeps us focused on the important role we can play.
<br><br>
Remedy was founded by a team of people with a long history in developing episode programs. Our team has extensive experience building organizations in the health insurance, health care delivery and information technology fields. We trace our roots to the first ever large-scale episode initiative at Oxford Health Plans in the mid 1990s. Our team also includes executives from HealthMarket, a commercial insurance episode program launched in 2000 that was the first health insurance plan to rely upon episodes to define and manage risk. Those initiatives informed the creation of Remedy Partners.
<br><br>
We believe that successful episode programs require a high level of cooperation between providers, outstanding technologies to link providers and patients, risk management systems that limit downside in taking episode risk, data analytics capabilities to measure and track care and performance, and financial management systems to manage claims and accurately report results. Remedy focuses on each of these challenges and develops solutions that allow our care teams to succeed.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Remedy started in a family of dreamers. Now our tribe is growing. We have developed a shared vision for what the future of the health care system can look like and how we can make a difference in people’s lives.
<br><br>
Bundled Payments represent an important advance in the organization and financing of health care services for a patient’s episode of care. Federal and State governments, as well as HMOs and large employer groups, are using bundled payments to accelerate the shift from fee for service to value based payment programs.
<br><br>
Remedy's solutions empower healthcare providers to develop and operate patient-centric episode of care payment programs leading to improved clinical outcomes, lower costs and increased patient satisfaction.

		<h3>Our Values</h3>
<h1>We believe in empathy, collaboration and fairness.</h1>
	</div>		
</section>

	<section class="our-values">
	<div class="container">
		<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>An “episode of care” is a phrase that means different things to different people. To providers and health care administrators, it is the services provided to a patient over a period of time for a particular condition. For patients, it is their unique experience with the health care system. This experience often happens after a sobering diagnosis. They are often frightened and confused by the health care system they now have to navigate - an often unfamiliar and intimidating environment.
<br><br>
At Remedy, we seek to be fully responsive to the patient’s needs and to recognize that Care Teams, including our own employees, are interacting with these patients at their most vulnerable moments. We take this responsibility seriously and constantly remind each other that the patient is someone’s mother, father, sister, brother, friend or relative.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Success in managing episodes of care depends on the collaboration and cooperation of multiple providers, often working in separate organizations or practices. While Remedy creates system platforms and mobile linkages to facilitate this collaboration, it is still the responsibility of providers to use the tools available to promote care coordination.
<br><br>
Care Teams are the key to succeeding in this new paradigm of care coordination. Physicians and other provider on each team must understand their obligations to each other, follow agreed upon protocols and pathways, and take actions that are mutually determined to advance the patient’s recovery. Because Remedy’s episode management platform provides real-time linkages between providers, we make it easy for them to track a patient’s progression and to be accountable to one another.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Fairness</h3>
<p>We believe that episode programs will only succeed if we structure contractual and financial relationships with and between providers that are fair and equitable. All of our programs treat Care Teams as partners who benefit from the success of our episode programs. At the same time, we seek to structure contracts with employers, health insurers and government programs that are responsive to their needs for affordability and quality.
